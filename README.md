# PortfolioSite

This project has been created with React, Redux Toolkit, and TypeScript.

The purpose of this project is to combine different projects I've worked on into a consolidated site with some flair.

I followed this [tutorial](https://betterprogramming.pub/complete-guideline-to-creating-a-modern-react-app-with-typescript-from-scratch-cebbb5817d8) for creating a React app with TypeScript from scratch (without react-create-app). For creating draggable components, I used some code from this [repo](https://github.com/nmingaleev/react-draggable-resizable-panel/tree/main).

Since I ran into an issue where React components aren't serializable, and therefore cannot be stored in Redux store, I modified code from this [repo](https://github.com/zasource-dev/React-Serialize) to serialize and deserialize components.
